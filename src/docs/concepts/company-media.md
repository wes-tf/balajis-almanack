 Every Company a Media Company
==================================

\*Unfinished\*

One of Balaji's core ideas around decentralized media is that every company will become a media company.

> 4) You are an expert in something. You have a responsibility as a citizen to do citizen journalism, to share that with the world

> 5) The media should not be “guardians of democracy” nor “enemies of the people”. Neither guardian nor enemy, just the people. All citizen journalists.

It is not in your interest to talk to employees of media corporations. It is in their interest.

In fact, media companies are competitors. Especially to Tech companies.

> That means it has gotten in the ring.

If you make a company on Facebook's API it can be taken away from you if they restrict access. The same goes for if your reputation is built using media companies. You do not have editorial control

On The Realignment podcast Ep. 43 Balaji explained how building your reputation as a company using media companies is analogous to building a company on a platform such as Facebook's API. Watch the video below or read the transcript:

They may shut you down not because they are against you, but because their economic incentives are not aligned.

> The whole concept of giving free content, quotes, interviews to legacy media corporations is obsolete.  
>   
> It’s a habit. A bad habit. Break it. And if you have news to break, break it on your own channels: your Twitter, YouTube, podcast, or blog.  
>   
> Don’t have a channel? Build one.

You do not need the media anymore to grow your company. All the tools to reach an audience are available for everyone on the internet.

Instead of just marketing, companies are going to be publishing full-stack narratives.

Every company has a Twitter already

Netflix and Amazon are already producing their own Hollywood movies
