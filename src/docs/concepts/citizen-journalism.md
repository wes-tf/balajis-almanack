Citizen Journalism (v1)
=======================

Some of Balaji's core ideas around decentralized media revolve around Citizen Journalism.

> 4) You are an expert in something. You have a responsibility as a citizen to do citizen journalism, to share that with the world  
>   
> 5) The media should not be “guardians of democracy” nor “enemies of the people”. Neither guardian nor enemy, just the people. All citizen journalists.

With citizen journalism, Balaji means individuals outside of institutions taking it upon themselves to write about topics they are experts on.

Why would we need citizen journalism? Because for certain topics you need a highly technical background to cover them.

The COVID-19 pandemic made the case for citizen journalism even stronger. Many media companies [initially dismissed the threat of the coronavirus (30:03)](https://soundcloud.com/paradoxpodcast/balaji-srinivasan), and made fun of Tech people who took it seriously.

In some cases, citizen journalism could literally save lives.

> It has also changed my mind on something, or at least changed priority. I now think it is \*crucial\* that people with scientific & engineering backgrounds (a) engage in citizen journalism and (b) attain political office.

Experts in a certain topic should be the ones writing about that topic. We need people with technological backgrounds publishing.

The idea is that citizen journalists publish out of a sense of civic duty.

> Thanks. To be fair, this is actually an NYT link! There is good and bad journalism.  
>   
> I've also been thinking more that it is our \*responsibility\* to do (eg) a year of citizen journalism each. Otherwise we have a critical deficit of writers with scientific & technical backgrounds.

> That’s the point actually: citizen journalists have a day job. The journalism is part-time, something they do out of a sense of civic responsibility.  
>   
> It’s not their personal business model. And so they need not mouth just-the-flu groupthink just to eat. [https://t.co/LDlKac3zID](https://t.co/LDlKac3zID) [https://t.co/iL2OaxKTGj](https://t.co/iL2OaxKTGj)

Because citizen journalists are not dependent on their posts for their income, they can have different incentives than legacy media companies. **Truth and differentiation can be incentivized.**

With regards to truth, citizen journalism would include decentralized factchecking, enabled by [the ledger of record](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1211777785460666368?s=20).

> I think the second part of citizen journalism is reproducible journalism, based on decentralized fact checking.

> This involves some new culture (citation of all sources, github-style corrections, etc) and some new technology. See this thread for details. [https://t.co/LLNf6daO0H](https://t.co/LLNf6daO0H)

And this is how Balaji argues differentiation will be incentivized:

> By the way, the Substack model incentivizes writers to differentiate rather than all repeat the same thing.  
>   
> That’s good for original writers and bad for centralized narratives.  
>   
> Individual monetization, distribution, reputation, content: that’s how we decentralize media.

[The internet turned everyone into publishers](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1191445815727984642). [You can now own your own distribution](https://balajis.com/how-to-gradually-exit-twitter/). And cryptocurrencies enable you to [separate your real name from your income](pseudonymous.md). These are all beneficial developments for citizen journalists.

The lines between media and citizens are fading. Citizen as journalists, and [every company a media company](company-media.md).

> Point being that the concept of the “press” as a entity distinct from the citizenry at large is going away. Every citizen a citizen journalist.  
>   
> And just as NYT is becoming a tech company, tech firms are building media arms. Every company a media company.[https://t.co/bBcIAMN7qS](https://t.co/bBcIAMN7qS)
